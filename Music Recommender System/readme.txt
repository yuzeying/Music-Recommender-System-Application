and then also put music_dataset folder (which contains 10000.txt and song_data.csv) in that folder too;

and run command of “python ./MRS.py” (this is for Mac, depending on your OS, the command line may be different, but make sure just run the MRS.py file) on the Terminal in the Python 3 environment.
